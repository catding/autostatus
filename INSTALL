0 - Make sure perl 5.0 or later is installed.
    Make sure 'fping' is installed.  Must be setuid root
    if autostatus is run as a non-root user.  (Don't run it
    as root).

    fping may be obtained from:

    ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/pub/packages/fping
    with docs at:  http://www.stanford.edu/~schemers/docs/fping/fping.html

1 - Run the "configure" script.  This will find the location
    of various programs, etc.

    o  Full configure semantics apply if you wish to change things.

    o  To install in a different location, supply --prefix=/other/location
       (such as --prefix=/usr/local/, which will cause the files to be
       installed in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share, etc).

    o  If you wish to build only tcpcheck, configure with --without-perl


2 - Type "make"

2a - type "make install"

3 - Create a configuration file containing the pathnames
    for important files.

3 - Create a "hosts" file (based on hosts.sample) containing
    your hosts, routers, and services to monitor.
   
4 - Create a cron entry which runs autostatus every now and then.
    Invoke as:

    autostatus <configuration file name>

    I use an entry like:

    1-59/5  *  *  *  *  /usr/local/bin/autostatus /home/danderse/as/local.cfg

5 - Install the icons you wish to use (see the icons directory for
    more information) in a web-accessible location.

6 - [OPTIONAL]

  If you do not run a webserver on the machine doing the monitoring,
  (and you don't have the status results written out to a public
   place where it can be read by your webserber), you may wish to run
   the fileserv.pl script.  To do so, set it up in inetd:

    http stream tcp nowait <user> <path> <path> <path-to-html-file>

  where <user> is a user who can read the HTML file, but has no
  special permissions.  I suggest 'nobody' if at all possible.
  DO NOT USE ROOT FOR THE USER.

  <path> is the path to the fileserv.pl script

  <path-to-conf-file> is the path to the configuration file with which
  autostatus is invoked.  Fileserv will read the location of the 'outfile'
  from this file, and display its contents.

  If you use fileserv, you'll need to specify a different icon path
  in your configuration file, since fileserv will only serve up
  ONE page, the status html page.
