    + Tested on:
          FreeBSD 2.5 and 3.0
	  Linux 2.0
          Solaris (SunOS 5.5)
	  HPBSD 2.0 (a local Utah thing)
	  HPUX 10.2
    - Doesn't work on:
	  HPUX 9.0
	  AIX 4.1  (both have non-posix selects).
  - Now takes a configuration file, so you don't need to modify the
    script for an installation.
  - Provides a 'make install' target to simplify installation.
  - fileserv.pl groks configuration files, too.
  - Supports building only 'tcpcheck' (supply --without-perl).
