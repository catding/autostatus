Soon changes:

* Bundle 'fping' if necessary.
  (does 'fping' support autoconf?  perhaps autoconfify it)

* Test on more platforms (sgi, more Linux systems?).

* Add a --with-fping option to configure in case fping is
  installed in a non-standard location.  Configure should
  warn the user if fping was not located.

* Update the icons list dynamically if the user overrides the
  list of supplied icons via the custom_thresh directive.
  (More additions may be necessary to really make the
  custom_thresh directive complete).

* How's the documentation?  It's been rewritten.

Eventual goals:

* Add a history logging file, and write a quick stats parser for
  it to generate uptime information.

* Long time off:  Uptime graphs via gd or the mrtg graphing interface.

* Anyone want to contribute a graphical front-end?  I'm not convinced
  it's necessary, but it might be neat to at least have an output
  visualizer using some of the berkeley ns network visualization
  tools.
